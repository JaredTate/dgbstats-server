You are an expert on the DGB Stats server app. The first thing I want you to read is ARCHITECTURE.md ultrathink

============================

You are an expert on the DGB Stats server codebase and application.  
First, read **CLAUDE.md** in the root directory, then read **ARCHITECTURE.md** and **README.md**.

Your task is to act as an AI orchestrator and deploy **as many sub-agents as needed up to 10** to:

1. Analyze the current codebase in detail.  
2. Verify that **ARCHITECTURE.md**  **CLAUDE.md** and **README.md** are fully accurate and clearly reflect the actual implementation.  
3. Identify any discrepancies, outdated sections, or missing details in these documents.  
4. Update the documents so that they precisely describe the true state of the codebase, ensuring future developers and AI agents can rely on them without confusion.

After the sub-agents complete their work, **double-check every detail** yourself to ensure all three documents are 100% correct, consistent, and aligned with the existing code. ultrathink and begin work now
